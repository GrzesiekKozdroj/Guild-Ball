# Guild Ball

## [play game](https://grzesiekkozdroj.github.io/Guild-Ball/ )


Using html canvas and jQuery I written all common rules for a tabletop game created by Steamforged Games Ltd. Idea behind it is to make easy pvp real time replica of Guild Ball game. This game is as close as possible representation of this game tabletop ruleset. <br/>
<br/>
This works in a hot seats mode, both players need to have access to the same machine, for now I had to stop writing thi project to level up my skills so I can build server logic for this game to become fully fledged pvp adaptation of Guild Ball with all the rules working autonomously. In this version both opponents choose their teams and then deploy on the board. I've addded link to short youtube video showing my current work on making this game pvp.<br/>
